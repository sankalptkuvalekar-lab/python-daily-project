#Open a File on the Server

f=open("/Users/sankalp/myfile.txt")

#The open() function returns a file object, which has a read() method for reading the content of the file:

print(f.read())

#Using the with statement

with open("/Users/sankalp/myfile.txt") as f:
 print(f.read())

 #Then you do not have to worry about closing your files, the with statement takes care of that.


#Close Files
#It is a good practice to always close the file when you are done with it.
#If you are not using the with statement, you must write a close statement in order to close the file:

f=open("/Users/sankalp/myfile.txt")
print(f.read())
f.close()

#Note: You should always close your files. In some cases, due to buffering, changes made to a file may not show until you close the file.


#Read Only Parts of the File
#By default the read() method returns the whole text, but you can also specify how many characters you want to return:

with open("/Users/sankalp/myfile.txt") as f :
  print(f.read(18))


  #Read Lines

  #You can return one line by using the readline() method:
with open("/Users/sankalp/myfile.txt") as f:
    print(f.readline())

    #By calling readline() two times, you can read the two first lines:


with open("/Users/sankalp/myfile.txt") as f:
    print(f.readline())
    print(f.readline())

#By looping through the lines of the file, you can read the whole file, line by line:

with open("/Users/sankalp/myfile.txt") as f:
   for x in f:
      print(x)
